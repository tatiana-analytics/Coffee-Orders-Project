This project started from a blank template, only using raw data of customer information, products, and orders. Some of the information was not already filled into certain columns, so data mining was used to fill in the appropriate	cells to complete the analysis, charts, tables, and dashboards.
	
Skills Used: XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, Multiplication basics, Multiple IF Functions, Date Formatting, Number Formatting, Checking for Duplicates, Convert Range to Tables, Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts & Formatting, Insert Timeline & Formatting, Insert Slicers & Formatting, and Building a Dashboard
